FONTLOG for the Beethoven font
==============================

This file provides detailed information on the Beethoven Font Software. This information should
be distributed along with the Beethoven fonts and any derivative works.

Basic font information
----------------------

Beethoven is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to mimic the typeface used by the G. Henle
publishing house in the mid 1950s. The glyphs were created as digitized outlines from several
hand-engraved Urtext scores by Henle, one of them being a compilation of Beethoven's piano
music, published in 1953. This font software is not designed for use in a word-processing
application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their respective Unicode points.
